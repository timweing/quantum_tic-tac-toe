				<h2>Game introduction</h2>
				<p>
					<b>TIPP: If you are new to quantum mechanics and quantum computers, please read the
					<a href="#intro">short introduction</a> first.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is played on the same playing field as the classic Tic-Tac-Toe
					by the players X and O. Each of the 9 squares is represented by a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubit</a>.
					Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is using additional concepts such
					as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a>, and
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse">collapse</a>.
					This makes quantum Tic-Tac-Toe on the one hand different and more complex,
					on the other hand of course more interesting than classical Tic-Tac-Toe.

					<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate"> Quantum gates</a>:	</b>
					Each qubit is initialized with the starting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state"> state</a> |1⟩ by means of <a href="#x-gate">X gates</a>.<br>
					<b>Sequence:	</b> Players take turns to make moves, with X making the first move.<br>
					<b>Move:	</b>Player X and player O are quantum players, which have the possibility of multiple
					quantum moves. These moves are as follows:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Switch:</b> In this move, an <a href="#x-gate">X gate</a> is attached to the selected qubit.
							This acts like a logical NOT and inverts (switches) the actual state.</li>
						<li><b>Maintain:</b> On this play, an <a href="#id-gate">ID gate</a> is attached to the selected qubit.
							Thus, it retains the state.</li>
						<li><b>Superposition:</b> In this move, an <a href="#h-gate">Hadamard gate (H gate)</a> is attached to the selected qubit.
							is attached. This retains it in superposition.</li>
						<li><b>Entanglement:</b> Moves can be entangled by moving two squares by the move
							"Entanglement." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">Entanglement</a>
							places a field in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>
							with an <a href="#h-gate">H gate</a> and
							then uses that field as the control qubit of a <a href="#cnot-gate">CNOT gate</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Number of operations per qubit:	</b>A maximum of three moves (quantum gates) per qubit can be played.<br>
					<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics">Measuring</a> the qubits:	</b>The 9 qubits are not measured and collapse
					to the classical state until all qubits have been played at least once.
					Measurement outcomes of “0” are assigned to player O and “1” to player X.
					Before the measurement we don’t know in all of the positions whether there will be a 0 or 1.
					So we cannot really say who would win. <br>
					<b>Winner: </b> After measuring the qubits, the winner is determined.
					As in the classic Tic-Tac-Toe, three of the same symbols in a row denotes the winner.
					It does not matter whether these three classical states are
					horizontal, vertical or diagonal in a row. There are four variants:
					<ul>
						<li>Player X has a row and player O does not: This means that X has won.</li>
						<li>Player O has a row and player X does not: Thus, O has won.</li>
						<li>No player has a row: This is a draw.</li>
						<li>A new possibility is, both players have a row: This is also a draw.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Additional settings: </b> The following additional settings are possible:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Use bot:</b> In this case player O is played by the computer. Some calculations
							might take some time so be patient.</li>
						<li><b>Beginner / expert:</b> This button toggles the game level. In the expert level no further
							information are displayed, only the last move is displayed in the playing field and
							the gates are initialized as |0⟩.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Quantum gates</h2>
				<p>
					The difference between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">quantum computer</a>
					and a classical computer arises
					on the one hand from the fact that they are built differently.
					On the other hand, the components with which the respective computer
					computes are also different. A classical computer calculates with bits,
					a logical, binary state, i.e., a state, which can take only two possible values.
					These values can be labeled true/false, on/off. However, they are
					most often represented as "1" or "0". In contrast, a quantum computer
					computes with so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubits</a> ("quantum bits").
					A qubit does not assume
					a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state">state</a> of either 1 or 0 like a classical bit, but a linear combination of these states.
					This linear combination of states is also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">"superposition"</a>.
					Each qubit is
					initialized with the |0⟩ state.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">Quantum gates</a>,
					unlike digital gates, are not devices. They can be thought of as
					manipulations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state">state</a> (spins) of a qubit. In this process,
					the ground state of a qubit is changed. In quantum Tic-Tac-Toe we use
					the following gates as moves:
					<ul>
						<li id="x-gate"><b>X gate:</b> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli_gates_(X,Y,Z)">Pauli-X gate or X gate</a>
							 is a 1-qubit gate,
							i.e., a gate that only acts on a single qubit. The X gate reverses the
							state vector of a qubit by inverting the amplitude of the respective
							base state |0⟩ or |1⟩. Thus, the Pauli X gate has the same function as
							the NOT gate in classical logic gates and is therefore often called bit flip.</li>
						<li id="id-gate"><b>ID gate:</b> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Identity_gate">identity gate or ID gate</a>
							acts on a single qubit and leaves the qubit in its actual state and
							therefore preserves the actual spin.</li>
						<li id="h-gate"><b>Hadamard-Gate:</b> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Hadamard_gate">Hadamard gate or H gate</a> is a gate that acts on a single qubit.
							Thereby the gate lifts the base state |0⟩ or |1⟩ into a superposition of the two possible states.
							The Hadamard gate is inverse to itself. Thus, it reverses itself when applied again.</li>
						<li id="cnot-gate"><b>CNOT gate:</b> The CNOT gate acts on two different qubits, a control qubit
							and a target qubit. When the qubits are in the base state |0⟩ or |1⟩,
							they behave like classical bits. In this state, the gate is very simple
							and intuitive to understand. Here, the CNOT gate performs a NOT operation
							on the second qubit when the base state of the first qubit is |1⟩.
							However, if the base state of the first qubit is |0⟩, then it does
							not change the base state of the second qubit. <br>
							We only use the CNOT gate in combination with the superposition as Bell state (see below).
						</li>
						<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">Bell state:</a></b> The combination of H gate and CNOT gate is called Bell state.
							The spin of an electron
							is a quantum mechanical property of the electron. The entanglement can be observed
							if two electrons are created simultaneously, and their spin
							is measured in two different apparatuses. It can be seen that the electrons
							always have opposite spin. But the fact that they always have an opposite spin after the measurement can
					 	  only be explained by the fact that in spite of spatial distance to each other the
					 	  electrons are to be understood as a system which is in superposition before the measurement.
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox">Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen formulated in 1935 the EPR effect</a>, according to which quantum
					 	 entanglement would lead to the violation of the classical principle of local realism,
					 	 which was called "spooky action at a distance" by Einstein in a famous quotation.</li>
					</ul>
					With the measurement of the qubits their state is detected. With this process the state
					also collapses in a
					base state of either |0⟩ or |1⟩. In quantum Tic-Tac-Toe this happens
					as soon as all qubits are at least played once.

				<h2>Why quantum Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a>
					is often perceived as complicated and confusing due to its drastically
					different kind of physical laws compared to classical physics. Concepts like
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a>, or
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation">teleportation</a>
					behave differently than we are used to in our
					world of Newton’s mechanics. Explanation attempts like
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> are hard to
					imagine and even Einstein had problems with the theory describing entanglement as
					"spooky action at a distance".
				</p>
				<p>
					The knowledge gained about this new world in recent years has increased enormously.
					Nevertheless, for many people, getting started in quantum mechanics is a difficult undertaking.
					It is hard to understand the concepts and their implications for laymen and even
					experienced physicists. With the rise of quantum computers more and more people are
					forced to deal with programming of quantum computers and thus need an understanding
					of quantum mechanics.
				</p>
 			  <p>
					There already exist several attempts to introduce quantum logic and quantum circuits,
					which form the basis for many quantum computers. Some of them use
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>  and
					games to provide an easy and attractive starting point. Anticipating the immense growth
					and high potential of this technology, it is also becoming important for many young people
					and students to learn about quantum computing at an early age. For this generation,
					it is important that the entry point is made interesting and attractive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is a learning
					environment that helps newcomers to get an impression of the behavior of single quantum
					gates and their combinations in
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit">quantum circuits</a>.
					Through the analysis of game tactics and
					move combinations like in chess the effects of gate combinations become comprehensible.
					Repeated exposure to these combinations promotes intuitive understanding of individual
					quantum gates.
